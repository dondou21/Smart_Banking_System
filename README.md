## Title: Smart Banking System

### Background
A bank wants to develop a Java-based Smart Banking System to manage customer accounts
efficiently. The system should allow users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money,
and check their balance. Additionally, the bank provides a reward system where Savings accounts
earn interest, and Current accounts may have an overdraft facility.

### Features Done
Students have already been introduced to some core functionalities using OOPs Concepts
(Source Code is shared ), including:
✔ Checking balance (checkBalance())
✔ Depositing money (deposit())
✔ Withdrawing money (withdraw())
However, students are required to extend the system by implementing additional features using
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts which are given below under the additional
challenge.

### Task To be Implemented Using
Your task is to develop a Java Console program that simulates a Smart Banking System using the
OOPs concepts you have learned, including:
✓ Classes & Objects (Define an Account class)
✓ Constructors & Constructor Overloading (Initialize account details with different
parameters)
✓ Constructor Chaining (Reuse constructors to initialize data efficiently)
✓ Methods & Method Overloading (Perform deposit, withdrawal, and balance check
operations)
✓ Loops & Conditional Statements (Ensure transaction validation and reward eligibility)
### Requirements:
#### 1. Create an Account class with attributes:
o accountNumber (Integer)
o accountHolderName (String)
o balance (Double)
o accountType (String) – Specifies either "Savings" or "Current".
#### 2. Implement constructor overloading to allow account creation with different sets of initial values.
#### 3. Define methods:
o deposit(double amount): Increases the balance.
o withdraw(double amount): Deducts the balance only if sufficient funds are
available.
o checkBalance(): Displays the current balance.
#### 4. Ensure proper input validation using loops and conditionals, ensuring:
o Deposits should be positive.
o Withdrawals should not exceed the balance.


### Additional Challenges Need To Be Integrated:
➢ Menu-Driven System: The system should not terminate until the user chooses to exit.
➢ Multiple Accounts Management: Allow multiple customers to open accounts and
perform transactions using an array or collection of Account objects.
➢ Extend your program by allowing multiple customers to open accounts and perform
transactions using an array of Account objects.
➢ Use constructor chaining to avoid redundant code when initializing account data.
➢ Implement an interest system where Savings accounts receive 4% annual interest.
➢ Overdraft Feature for Current Accounts: Allow Current Accounts to withdraw
beyond their balance, up to a certain overdraft limit.
➢ Maintain accountType (String – "Savings" or "Current")
